        <h2>TAJ MAHAL</h2>
        <p>The Taj Mahal represents the finest and most sophisticated
             example of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its origin lies in the
              moving circumstances of its commission and the culture and 
              history of an Islamic Mughal empire's rule of large parts of India.
               The distraught Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned the project upon 
               the death of one of his favorite wives Mumtaz Mahal.

        A masterpiece of the Mughal chief architect Ahmad ma'mar, it is one of the most
         famous and recognizable buildings in the world today. While the large, domed marble 
         mausoleum is the most familiar part of the monument, the Taj Mahal is an extensive complex
          of buildings and gardens that extends over 22.44 hectares (55.5 acres) and includes
           subsidiary tombs, waterworks infrastructure, the small town of Taj Ganji to the south and a 'moonlight garden' 
           to the north of the river. Construction of Taj Mahal began in 1632 AD, (1041 AH), on the south bank of the River
            Yamuna in Agra, and was substantially complete by 1648 AD (1058 AH). The design was conceived as an earthly replica
             of the house of Mumtaz Mahal in paradise.</p>

    <h1>HAWA MAHAL</h1>
    <p>This palace is a five-storey pyramidal shaped monument that rises to about 50 feet (15 m). The top three floors of
         the structure have the width of a single room, while the first and second floors have patios in front of them. 
         The front elevation, as seen from the street, is like a honeycomb with small portholes. Each porthole has miniature
          windows and carved sandstone grills, finials and domes. It gives the appearance of a mass of semi-octagonal bays,
           giving the monument its unique façade. The inner face on the back side of the building consists of chambers built 
           
           with pillars and corridors with minimal ornamentation, and reach up to the top floor. The interior of the palace
            has been described as "having rooms of different coloured marbles, relieved by inlaid panels or gilding, while
             fountains adorn the centre of the courtyard".

Lal Chand Ustad was the architect. Built-in red and pink coloured sandstone, in keeping with the décor of the other monuments 
in the city, its colour is a full testimony to the epithet of "Pink City" given to Jaipur. Its façade with 953 niches with
 intricately carved jharokhas (some are made of wood) is a stark contrast to the plain-looking rear side of the structure. Its
  cultural and architectural heritage is a reflection of a fusion of Hindu Rajput architecture and Islamic Mughal architecture; the
   Rajput style is seen in the form of domed canopies, fluted pillars, lotus, and floral patterns, and the Islamic style is evident 
   in its stone inlay filigree work and arches (as distinguished from its similarity with the Panch Mahal at Fatehpur Sikri).

The entry to the Hawa Mahal from the city palace side is through an imperial door. It opens into a large courtyard, which has 
double-storeyed buildings on three sides, with the Hawa Mahal enclosing it on the east side. An archaeological museum is also 
housed in this courtyard.

Hawa Mahal was also known as the chef-d'œuvre of Maharaja Jai Singh as it was his favourite resort because of the elegance 
and built-in interior of the Mahal. The cooling effect in the chambers, provided by the breeze passing through the small windows
 of the façade, was enhanced by the fountains provided at the centre of each of the chambers.

The top two floors of the Hawa Mahal are accessible only through ramps. The Mahal is maintained by the archaeological 
department of the Government of Rajasthan</p>

    <h1 id="w">Red Fort</h1><hr>
    <p>Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned the construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1639, following his decision to shift his capital
         from Agra to Delhi. The design of the Red Fort is attributed to the architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, renowned for his work on 
        the Taj Mahal. It straddles the Yamuna River, which once fed the moats surrounding most of the walls. Construction 
        began in the sacred Islamic month of Muharram, on 13 May 1638. Supervised by Shah Jahan, it was completed on 6 April 1648.
         The fort was originally adorned in red and white. Unlike other Mughal forts, the Red Fort's boundary walls are asymmetrical to 
        contain and subsume the older Salimgarh Fort. The fortress-palace served as the centrepiece of Shahjahanabad, the city now
         known as Old Delhi. Shah Jahan's successor, Emperor Aurangzeb, enhanced the Red Fort by adding the Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) 
         to the emperor's private quarters. He also constructed barbicans in front of the two main gates to create a more circuitous 
         approach to the palace.

 extending a couple of thousand meters.

Following the death of Emperor Aurangzeb, the administrative and fiscal structure of the Mughal dynasty experienced decline,
 leading to the degeneration of the palace during the 18th century. In 1712, Jahandar Shah was crowned the Mughal Emperor.
  Within a year of beginning his rule, Shah was murdered and replaced by Farrukhsiyar. In 1739, the Persian emperor Nadir Shah 
decisively defeated the Mughal army, despite its considerable strength of approximately 200,000 soldiers. Following his victory,
 he plundered the Red Fort, seizing its treasures, including the legendary Peacock Throne. After three months, Nadir Shah returned to 
Persia. His invasion left the city significantly damaged, and the Mughal Empire, under the next Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah's reign, 
was severely weakened. The internal weaknesses of the Mughal Empire reduced the Mughals to titular rulers of Delhi. A treaty 
signed in 1752 established the Marathas as the protectors of the throne in Delhi. The 1758 Maratha victory over the Afghans
 at Sirhind, followed by their defeat at Panipat, catapulted them into further conflict with Ahmad Shah Durrani.

In 1760, the Marathas stripped and melted the silver ceiling of the Diwan-i-Khas to raise funds for the defence of Delhi from the 

armies of Ahmed Shah Durrani. In 1761, after the Marathas lost the third battle of Panipat, Delhi was raided by Durrani. Ten
 years later, the Marathas, acting at the behest of the exiled Emperor Shah Alam II, recaptured Delhi from the Rohilla Afghans. 
 Mahadaji Shinde, the commander of the Maratha Army, restored Shah Alam II to the throne.

In 1764, the Jat ruler of Bharatpur, Maharaja Jawahar Singh, attacked Delhi, and eventually captured the Red Fort of Delhi on 
5 February 1765. Two days later, after exacting tribute from the Mughals, the Jats withdrew their forces from the Red Fort, 
seizing the Mughal throne. The throne now adorns the palace at Deeg, serving as a historical centrepiece. The doors of the fort
 are located in the Lohagarh Fort of Bharatpur.

In 1783, Sikh Misls led by Jassa Singh Ahluwalia, Jassa Singh Ramgarhia, and Baghel Singh Dhaliwal conquered Delhi and the Red Fort.
 With a consolidated force consisting of 40,000 troops, they looted the area spanning from Awadh to Jodhpur. After negotiations, the 
 Sikh forces agreed to withdraw from Delhi and reinstate the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II. As a condition of their retreat, the Jats 
 stipulated the construction of seven Sikh gurdwaras in Delhi, including the Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib in Chandni Chowk.

In 1788, the grandson of Najibkhan, Rohilla, Ghulam Kadir, looted Delhi and killed female members of the Mughal royal family. He also
 imprisoned Emperor Shah Alam II. Upon learning this, Mahadaji Shinde sent his men to free Shah Alam and pursue Kadir, who was hiding 
 in Ghosgad in Rohilkhand. Kadir was eventually apprehended and beheaded. As a result of this, the Maratha flag was allowed to be hung
  from the Red Fort until 1803.

During the Second Anglo-Maratha War, the forces of the East India Company defeated the Maratha troops led by Daulat Rao Scindia in the
 Battle of Delhi; this event marked the end of Maratha control over Delhi and their authority over the Red Fort. After the battle,
  the British East India Company took over the administration of Mughal territories and installed a Resident at the Red Fort. The last 
  Mughal emperor to occupy the fort, Bahadur Shah II, became a symbol of the 1857 rebellion against the British East India Company, in 
  which the residents of Shahjahanabad participated.

Despite its position as the seat of Mughal power and its defensive capabilities, the Red Fort was not a site of any engagements 
during the 1857 uprising against the British. After the rebellion was subdued, Bahadur Shah II left the fort on 17 September and 
was subsequently apprehended by British forces. Bahadur Shah Zafar II returned to Red Fort as a British prisoner, was tried in 1858, 
and was exiled to Rangoon on 7 October that year. After the conclusion of the rebellion, the British sacked the Red Fort before 
ordering its systematic demolition. As a result of this widespread destruction, 80% of the fort's structures were demolished, including 
the stone screen that once connected the pavilions along the river-facing façade of the fort. All furniture was either removed or
 destroyed; the harem apartments, servants' quarters, and gardens were demolished, and a line of stone barracks was erected atop them.
  Only the marble buildings on the east side of the imperial enclosure escaped complete destruction, although they were damaged
  while demolition was underway. While the defensive walls and towers were relatively unscathed, over two-thirds of the inner structures
   were demolished.

Lord Curzon, who served as the Viceroy of India from 1899 to 1905, initiated restoration efforts for the Red Fort. These included the 
reconstruction of its walls and the revival of its gardens, complete with an updated watering system.

The majority of the jewels and artwork housed in the Red Fort were looted during Nadir Shah's invasion in 1747, and yet again in the 
aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. They were eventually sold to private collectors or the British Museum, the British Library, 
and the Victoria and Albert Museum. For instance, Shah Jahan's jade wine cup and Bahadur Shah II's crown, both looted, are currently 
held in London. Various requests for restitution have so far been rejected by the British Government.

1911 witnessed the visit of King George V and Queen Mary for the Delhi Durbar. In anticipation of their visit, some buildings were 
restored. The Red Fort Archaeological Museum was moved from the drum house to the Mumtaz Mahal.

The INA trials, also known as the Red Fort Trials, refer to the court-martial of a number of officers of the Indian National Army.
 The first trial was conducted at the Red Fort between November and December 1945.

On 15 August 1947, the first prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian national flag above the Lahore Gate.

After Indian independence, the site experienced few changes, and the Red Fort continued to be used as a military cantonment. A 
significant portion of the Red Fort remained under the control of the Indian Army until 22 December 2003, when it was transferred 
to the Archaeological Survey of India for restoration and conservation.In 2009, the Comprehensive Conservation and 
Management Plan (CCMP), prepared by the Archaeological Survey of India under the auspices of a Supreme Court direction to revitalise 
the fort, was announced.

In recent years, several museums and galleries have been added to the Red Fort complex. Four of these museums, inaugurated in 2019, 
are housed in the colonial-era barracks within the complex. Barrack B1 is dedicated to the 1857 War of Independence, Barrack B2 
commemorates the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and Barrack B3 focuses on Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army movement. 
Barrack , known as Drishyakala, is a collaboration between the Archaeological Survey of India and the Delhi Art Gallery and 
showcases Indian art. The earlier museums, including the Indian Freedom Fighters' Museum, the Mumtaz Mahal Museum, and the Naubat 
Khana Museum, have been closed, with their exhibits relocated to these newly established museums.</p>

        <h1>QUTUB MINAR</h1>
        <p><b>Quwwat-ul-Islam</b> mosque (built 1192 - 1316) Quwwat-ul-Islam was sponsored by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, founder of the Delhi 
            Sultanate. The Quwwat-ul-Islam is best known for its tower of victory, celebrating the Islamic conquest of India.
             27 Jain and Hindu temples were dismantled and their stonework salvaged into the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque.
            It consists of a rectangular courtyard enclosed by cloisters. Perhaps it was the first monument of iconoclast in India.
            It is in contradiction to Hasan Nizami's account of Aibak as peaceful and 'Lakh Baksh' or 'giver of lakhs' in his book 
            Taj-ul-Masir. It is said he was generous and spent huge sums in charity. But it may also be that the monument was 
            hurriedly built with the building material from the temple as Aibak had not established himself firmly in India at 
            that time.

            Quwwat-ul-Islam, the "Glory of Islam," was hastily erected by the young amir, who conscripted an army of local craftsmen, presumably
            Hindus, to assemble the structure thought there is no evidence to confirm the religious demography of the craftsmen

            The Qūwat-ul-Islām mosque (completed 1196), consisting of cloisters around a courtyard with the sanctuary to the west, was built in
            Delhi from the remains of demolished temples celebrating the Muslim conquest of India. It is built of red sandstone, gray quartz,
            and white marble, but is probably inspired by the “Iron Pillar " that stands on the site. Built in the Gupta dynasty in the 6th
            century, it is the only piece of the temple that stands in its original location. Qutb built around it when he constructed the
            mosque. Although made of iron, it has resisted rust for over 1,500 years.

            Later, a lofty arched screen was erected and the mosque was enlarged by later Delhi sultans Shams-ud-Din Iltutmish (A.D. 1210 - 1235)
            and Ala-ud-Din Khalji. The Iron Pillar in the courtyard bears an inscription in Sanskrit in Brahmi script of fourth century A.D., 
            according to which the pillar was set up as a Vishnudhvaja (standard of god Vishnu) on the hill known as Vishnupada in memory of a
            mighty king named Chandra. A deep socket on the top of the ornate capital indicates that probably an image of Garuda was fixed into 
            it.This was congregational mosque of the first city built by sultans, described in chronicles as Dehli-i-Kuhna (the old city).</p>

        <h1><span></span>CHARMINAR</span></h1>
        <p>The fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, built the Charminar in 1591 after shifting his capital
             from Golconda to the newly formed city of Hyderabad.
            The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the current caretaker of the monument, mentions in its records, "There are various
             theories regarding the purpose for which Charminar was constructed. However, it is widely accepted that Charminar was built at 
             the centre of the city, to commemorate the eradication of plague", a deadly disease which was widespread at that time.
             According to Jean de Thévenot, a French traveller of the 17th century whose narration was complemented with the available
              Persian texts, the Charminar was constructed in the year 1591 CE, to commemorate the beginning of the second Islamic 
              millennium year (1000 AH). The event was celebrated far and wide in the Islamic world, thus Qutb Shah founded the city of
               Hyderabad to celebrate the event and commemorate it with the construction of this building.

The construction began in 1589 and was completed in two years at a cost of Rs. 9 lakhs, which was around 2 lakh huns/gold coins in
 those times. Upon completion, it was the tallest structure in Hyderabad. It is said to weigh around 14000 tonnes with a minimum of 
 30 feet deep foundation. In 1670, a minaret had fallen after being struck by lightning. It was then repaired at a cost of around
  Rs. 58000. In 1820, some part of it was renovated by Sikandar Jah at a cost of Rs. 2 lakh.

The Charminar was constructed at the intersection of the historical trade route that connects the city to international markets 
through the port city of Machilipatnam. The Old City of Hyderabad was designed with Charminar as its centrepiece.The
 city was spread around the Charminar in four different quadrants and chambers, segregated according to the established settlements.
  Towards the north of Charminar is the Char Kaman, or four gateways, constructed in the cardinal direction.
  Additional eminent architects from Persia were also invited to develop the city plan. The structure itself was intended 
  to serve as a mosque and madrasa. It is of Indo-Islamic architecture style, incorporating Persian architectural elements. 
  A sample of Charminar is said to have been created at Dabirpura/Nagaboli graveyard before the actual construction.
