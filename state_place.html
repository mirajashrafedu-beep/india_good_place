Darjeeling, Nepal, Bengal, Bhutan, Sikkim, and Tibet

Darjeeling lies between the Mechi and Teesta rivers in the Eastern Himalayas. In the 18th century, it was part
 of a boundary region that had stirred ambitions and insecurities in several South Asian states. For the greater
  part of the century, the Chogyal-ruler of the northern Kingdom of Sikkim had asserted possession of this 
  territory. In the closing decades, the Gurkha kingdom of Nepal expanded eastwards to bring Darjeeling into
   its territory. Its army stopped short of the Teesta, beyond which at the time lay the Kingdom of 
   Bhutan.

The English East India Company began to show an interest in the Darjeeling hills in the early 19th century.
 At the time Darjeeling's indigenous population largely consisted of the Lepcha and Limbu peoples.The Company's
  interference in territorial matters began in the aftermath of its army's victory over the Gurkhas in the
   Anglo-Nepalese War. Fought between 1814 and 1816, the war concluded with two treaties, the Treaty of Sugauli 
   and the Treaty of Titalia, under which Nepal was required to return the Darjeeling territory to Sikkim.

In 1829, two East India Company officials, Captain George Lloyd and J. W. Grant, en route to resolving a boundary
 dispute between Nepal and Sikkim, passed a crescent-shaped mountain ridge which they fancied excellent for a 
 sanitorium for the British, or a resort for sheltering and recuperating from the heat of India's plains.
  Lord William Bentinck, the Governor-General of India, to whom Lloyd communicated his notion, concurred,
   recommending a small presence of the army in addition for monitoring the frontier.

1835–1857: East India Company rule
Taking the ambition forward, in 1835 the East India Company negotiated the lease of a 40 by 10 kilometres 
(24 by 6 miles) strip of land in a grant deed from the Chogyal. By the end of 1838, sappers from the army
 were readied for clearing the woods and construction planned in earnest after the monsoon rains. The following
  year, Archibald Campbell, a physician, was made "superintendent" of Darjeeling, and two public buildings, a hotel and a courthouse were raised.[23] Soon, work had begun on bungalows that conformed to British tastes.[1]

The Hill Stations and summer capitals at the end of East India Company rule (1857)
Turning Darjeeling into a resort required many more workers than were available in the scattered local
 populations.The British attracted workers from the neighbouring kingdoms, chiefly from Nepal but also
  from Sikkim and Bhutan. They did so by offering regular wages and lodgings, a contrast to the burdensome tax and
   forced labour regimens common in those kingdoms at the time. Tens of thousands arrived in Darjeeling. Not 
   long after the Darjeeling Hill Cart Road was built in Northern Bengal, connecting Siliguri at the base of the
    Himalayan foothills to Darjeeling.

In 1833 the East India Company lost its monopoly rights in the tea trade with China. A plan was prepared 
for growing tea in India. Superintendent Campbell began experimentation in 1840 in Darjeeling which soon proved 
successful.[26] European planters and sponsors acquired large stretches of the surrounding hillside and converted 
them to plantations, called tea gardens. Existing tracks and paths in the hills were improved, renamed as roads,
 and connected to the Hill Cart Road. The botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, who visited Darjeeling in the 1840s, noted
  that carts and pack animals on these roads were bringing fruit and produce from Nepal, wool and salt from Tibet,
   and labourers looking for work from just about everywhere.

The labour migrations created a burgeoning hostility between the East India Company and the neighbouring Himalayan
 kingdoms.[1] By 1849 the hostility came to a head. Campbell and Hooker were allegedly kidnapped.Despite the two
  being released without harm, the British exploited the incident to annex some 1,700 square kilometres (640 sq mi)
   of territory between the Mechi and the Teesta rivers from Sikkim.

Darjeeling became a municipality in 1850.[5] In the span of 15 years, this Himalayan tract had become a hill 
station, an official retreat for British administrators in a hilly, temperate, region of India. Hill stations,
 such as Simla (summer capital of the British Indian Empire), Ooty (summer capital of the Madras Presidency), and 
 Nainital (summer capital of the North-Western Provinces) were all established between 1819 and the 1840s, a period 
 during which the rule of the East India Company had spread to the greater part of the Indian subcontinent and the 
 British felt confident about planning them. Darjeeling later became the summer capital of the Bengal 
 Presidency.

1858–1947: British Raj
From 1850 to 1870 the tea industry in Darjeeling grew to 56 tea gardens employing some 8,000 labourers. 
The tea gardens' security forces kept a close watch on the labourers and used coercion when necessary to maintain 
intensive production. The labourers' disparate cultural and ethnic backgrounds and the tea gardens' commonly remote
 locations ensured the absence of worker mobilization. By the turn of the 20th century, 100 tea gardens employed
  an estimated 64,000 workers,[31] and more than five million pound sterling were invested in Darjeeling tea.
  The widespread deforestation caused by the tea industry drastically changed the lives of the region's forest
   dwellers, who were either forced to relocate to other forests or become employed in their former habitat in 
   new colonial occupations. To the mix of the forest dwellers recruited, more labourers joined from across 
   the Himalayas. They communicated with each other in the Nepali language. Later the language, and their
    customs and traditions would create the distinctive ethnicity of Darjeeling, called Indian Gorkha.

By the last decades of the 19th century, large numbers of administrative officials of the imperial and British
 Raj provincial governments had begun to travel to hill stations during the summers. Commerce in the stations
  had grown as had the trade with the plains. A train service to Darjeeling was announced in 1872. By 1878
   trains could take summer residents from Calcutta, the capital of the British Indian Empire, to Siliguri
    at the base of the Darjeeling hills. Thereafter, Tonga horse-carriages were required to cover the last stretch 
    on the Hill Cart Road. Ascending some 1,900-metre (6,300 ft), the journey required stopping at "halting
     barracks", or stables for feeding or changing the horses. By 1880, railway tracks were being aligned along
      the Hill Cart Road, and the East Indian Railway Company Jamalpur Locomotive Workshop had begun to build
       steam locomotives for the route. Miniature steam engines made by Sharp, Stewart and Company of
        Manchester, were employed for pulling the train on a narrow gauge of two feet. The train service to 
        Darjeeling was opened in July 1881. After cresting at the Ghoom railway station at 2,300-metre
         (7,500 ft) above sea level, the train made a descent to Darjeeling. Darjeeling was now within
          a day's travel from Calcutta.


The quadrangle of St Joseph's College, Darjeeling, now St Joseph's School, or North Point, established in 1888
Education became another aspect of Darjeeling's notability by the turn of the 20th century. After the Charter Act
 1833, which allowed unrestricted immigration, British women had begun to arrive in India in significantly more
  numbers than before. Hill stations became popular summer destinations for women and children as colonial
   physicians recommended them for improved maternal and infant health.The British soon began to consider
    hill stations promising sites for primary and secondary education. St Paul's, an Anglican boys' school
     in Calcutta, was moved to Darjeeling in 1864.The Catholic Church opened St Joseph's College for boys
      in Darjeeling in 1888. For girls, the Loreto Convent had already been established during Company rule;
       the Calcutta Christian Schools Society established the Queen's Hill School in Darjeeling in 1895.
        Anglo-Indians (of mixed British and Indian ancestry) were discouraged from attending the better-known
         schools and Indians were almost always prohibited until after World War I.

In 1945, as the British Raj was drawing towards a close, the Nepalese-speaking Indian Gorkha residents of 
Darjeeling had not been granted rights as British Indian subjects. These residents were at the bottom of the
 economic ladder, and their physical appearance was now the occasional object of racism by Indians from the plains.
  The 1941 census had shown that the Gorkha in Darjeeling constituted 86% of the population. They made up 96% of 
  the labour force in the tea gardens. Many had been recruited to fight for the British in the Second World 
  War, but the British had been reluctant to displease the governments of Nepal and the Kingdom of Sikkim whose 
  feudal labour regimes many original migrants had sought to escape.

1947 onwards: independent India

After the partition of India in 1947, Darjeeling became a part of the new province of West Bengal in the Dominion
 of India, and in 1950, of the state of West Bengal in the Republic of India. A British exodus from
  Darjeeling quickly followed. Their cottages were quickly purchased by the Indian upper classes from the
   plains who enrolled their children in the town's many schools. These actions created social and economic
    tensions with the Indian Gorkha population and further marginalised the latter. Their lack of economic
     development, caused by a hierarchal economic system set up by the British, continued in some respects in 
     the immediate decades after 1947. The Indian nationalism that emerged seemed to highlight the unclear
      position of the Indian Nepalis in the newly independent nation. The division of India into states
       comprising the regions of its different spoken languages had allowed a relatively large proportion of
        the educated speakers of these languages to find employment in the government-owned enterprises. In the
         instance of the Gorkhas, the federal and state governments refused to accept their requests for their
          own Nepali-speaking state in the northern regions of Bengal. Eventually, the demands for autonomy 
          were downsized to calls for the recognition of the Nepali language for official state business in 
          Nepali-speaking regions of Bengal. This was accepted in the West Bengal Official Language Act,
           1961.

Darjeeling had a sizeable community of Sherpas, an ethnic group, originally from eastern Tibet whose ancestors 
had moved to some villages in Nepal below Mount Everest. Sherpas had come to Darjeeling in the second half of the
 19th century as seasonal labourers looking for work in road-building. As mountaineering in the Himalayas
  had gained popularity and Nepal was closed to foreigners, many Western mountaineers and enthusiasts came to 
  Darjeeling to plan their Himalayan expeditions.The Sherpas stood out for their exceptional physical ability
   as porters, their fitness eliciting visits to Darjeeling by European biochemis in the early 1900s. 
   Among the most famous Sherpas who moved to Darjeeling werAng Tharkay[ and Tenzing Norgay.
    On 29 May 1953, Tenzing and Edmund Hillary became the first two humans to stan atop Mount Everest, 
    vaulting both to instant stardom worldwide. The prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, took Tenzing
     under his wing. Tenzing became the first field director of the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute
      after it was established in Darjeeling in November 1954

A trickle of immigrants from Tibet proper into Darjeeling had begun in the second half of the 19th century.
Wealthy Tibetan aristocrats had sent their children to Darjeeling's schools, and some went on to settle in the 
Darjeeling area. After the annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China in 1950–1951, many Tibetans
 emigrated to India, with some settling in the Darjeeling area, including the 14th Dalai Lama's older brother 
 Gyalo Thondup. After the 1959 Tibetan uprising, the Dalai Lama himself fled to exile in India, and tens of
  thousands of Tibetan refugees poured in after him, with many finding refuge in the Darjeeling–Kalimpong area
  . A Tibetan Refugee Self Help Centre was established in Darjeeling in 1959.

In May 1975, the Kingdom of Sikkim to the north of Darjeeling was absorbed into the Republic of India through a 
referendum. A month thereafter, Sikkim, in which nearly two-thirds of the populace spoke Nepali, was made a state
 of India. It was not lost on the Gorkhas of the Darjeeling region that there were many more speakers of Nepali
  in the Gorkha districts of northern Bengal, and their calls for autonomy had borne no fruit. The Government 
  of India, moreover, hadbeen reluctant to recognise Nepali as an official language in the Constiution of India.
   Slights delivered by senior Indian leadership around this issue—Morarji Desai, a former prime minister 
  calling Nepali a foreign language, and Vallabhbhai Patel, a former deputy prime minister, describing the Gorkhas
   as disloyal and entertaining "Mongoloid prejudices"—were all remembered. A decade later, during 
   Rajiv Gandhi's prime ministership, small regions in Assam to the east of Darjeeling, which had been riven by
    violent ethnic separatism, were granted statehood. All these factors played into creating a militant mood
     among the Gorkhas for statehood and brought the Gorkhaland movement to the forefront. It led to the
      founding of the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) under the leadership of Subhas Ghising. Agitation
      
      for a separate state in Darjeeling included violent protests,and fighting between the disparate 
      militant groups. The agitation ceased after an agreement was reached between the government and the 
      Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF). It resulted in the establishment of an elected body in 1988, the
       Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC), which received some autonomy to govern the district.

In 1992, the Nepali language was recognized officially at the federal level in India by inclusion in the Indian 
Constitution. Though Darjeeling became peaceful, the issue of a separate state lingered. Agitation for
 a new state again erupted in 2008, led by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM). In July 2011, a pact was signed
  between GJM, the state and national governments which included an elected Gorkhaland Territorial Administration
   (GTA), with limited autonomy within the state of West Bengal. It evoked little enthusiasm on the streets.
    In 2013, fresh agitation broke out in Darjeeling after Telangana, a region in southern India was granted 
    statehood. Four years later, more agitation caused several months of violence, food shortages, and 
    strikes in Darjeeling but resulted in the Morcha splitting into factions. In 2017, Mamata Banerjee,
     the West Bengal chief minister, appointed a moderate Morcha politician to leadership in a reconstituted 
     GTA, marginalizing and eventually ousting the founder of the movement, Bimal Gurung.</p></div>
